### Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Setting Up and Starting Debugging in VS Code
1. Install Necessary Extensions:
•	Depending on the language you're using, you might need to install relevant extensions. For example, for Python, install the "Python" extension by Microsoft. For JavaScript/Node.js, VS Code has built-in support.
2. Open Your Project:
•	Open your project folder in VS Code using File > Open Folder.
3. Create a Simple Program:
•	Create a new file with your program code. For example, a simple Python program could be:
4. Configure the Debugger:
•	Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code (or press Ctrl + Shift + D).
•	Click on create a launch.json file link to create a configuration file. VS Code will suggest templates based on the project type.
    ]
5. Add Breakpoints:
•	Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers in your code editor to add a breakpoint. A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint.
6. Start Debugging:
•	Click the green play button in the Debug view or press F5 to start debugging. The debugger will start and hit the breakpoints you've set.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
1.	Breakpoints:
o	Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code. Conditional breakpoints can be set to pause only when certain conditions are met.
2.	Watch Expressions:
o	Add watch expressions to evaluate variables or expressions at runtime. This helps in monitoring the values as you step through the code.
3.	Call Stack:
o	View the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in execution. This is crucial for tracing the flow of the program.
4.	Variables:
o	Inspect and modify variables in the current scope. The Variables panel displays local, global, and environment variables.
5.	Step Controls:
o	Step Over (F10): Execute the current line of code and move to the next line.
o	Step Into (F11): Dive into functions to see what's happening inside.
o	Step Out (Shift + F11): Step out of the current function and return to the caller.
o	Continue (F5): Continue execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.
6.	Debug Console:
o	Execute arbitrary expressions in the Debug Console to inspect variables and run commands in the context of the paused program.
7.	Integrated Terminal:
o	Use the integrated terminal to run commands and see the output directly within VS Code.
8.	Exception Breakpoints:
o	Configure the debugger to break execution when exceptions are thrown, even if no breakpoints are set.
9.	Source Control Integration:
o	See the current state of your codebase, including changes and diffs, directly within the debugging environment.

### Using Source Control:

### How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Integrating Git with VS Code for version control involves the following  few key steps:
•	initializing a repository
•	making commits
•	pushing changes to GitHub.
 Here’s a detailed guide on how to do it:
o	First, ensure Git is installed on your system
o	Launch VS Code and open your project folder.
o	Open source control by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code
o	Click on the Initialize Repository button. This action creates a .git directory in your project folder, initializing it as a Git repository.
o	The next step is to stage all the changes made. Go to the file you want to stage and click the plus icon (+) to stage it. To stage all changes, click the stage all changes (checkmark) icon

## commiting
o	Now we have to commit the changes. Enter a commit message in the message input box at the top of the Source Control view. Click the checkmark icon above the message box to commit the staged changes.

## pushing to github
o	We now have to push the changes to github. So, first log in to your Github account.C reate a new repository then choose visibility options(public or private)
o	You now have to add a remote Repository: In VS Code, open the terminal then Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:
“git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git”
o	Use the terminal to push your commits to GitHub:
“git push -u origin master”
